Using DeepQ learning to play BlackJack

Player_Game consists of the game BlackJack, where the user can play against the dealer who follows the rule to hit until 17. 

The agent was trained over 1000 games, with tuned reward parameters. Over time, the agent learned when to hold and when to hit given the sum of the cards at play and the shown card from the dealer. The imahe below shows the bots action given the cards at play.
